## Executive Summary

SIS, or the Student Information System, is used at RIT for many functions. It allows students to select classes, check grades, see their progress in their degree, update emergency information, and many more. Though it has these features, many of these features feel very clunky, making it difficult to use for the average student. Our view on this application is the class selection system. The current system lacks many features such as viewing different class options, viewing a calendar, enrolling by requirements and many more. This makes it difficult to select the correct classes, as the only check the system does is whether it conflicts with another class, or if prerequisites are missing. This is where a new system, SIS++, could be very beneficial.
	
SIS++ is an application that would replace the old class selection. This system would include new features, which would include searching by requirements, recommendations for courses, viewing professor ratings and previewing class schedules. This application would also support advisors viewing schedules as well, to better advise their students. These features would allow the users a significantly better experience, and would also limit the amount of time students spend selecting classes, as they would have a better understanding throughout the selection process.
